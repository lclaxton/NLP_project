# NLP_project
A project to investigate the skills required for data scientists as seen on linked in using NLP


Inspiration:

As someone who is keen to transition from academia into datascience I want to see what the most common skills required are. Moreover, I want to understand what the common requirements for entry level data scientists are. My hope is through doing this project I can learn more about NLP and understand where to target future learning so I can be in the best position to get a job in data science when the time comes.

Ambition for this project:
- Find most common skills required 
- Better understand the role 
- Aim to integrate a web scraping tool to better load and gather data
